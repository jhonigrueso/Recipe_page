    <section class="intructions">
      <h2 class="subintructions">Instructions</h2>
      <div class="intruction">
        <i class="icons">1</i><p>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F
          (177°C).</p><br>
        <i class="icons">2</i><p><strong>Make the crust</strong>: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into
        crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar
        and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the food processor.) Mixture will be
        sandy.
        Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease
        the pan
        first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the
        oven
        and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in
        step 4.
        Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</p><br>
        <i class="icons">3</i><p><strong>Make the filling</strong>: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a
          paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
          until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice
          then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a
          time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop
          mixing.
          To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you
          can.</p><br>
        <i class="icons">4</i><p><strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</strong> Boil a pot of water. You
          need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire
          kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or
          spoon
          to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water
          inside of
          the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in.
          Whichever is easier for you.)</p><br>
        <i class="icons">5</i><p>Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done,
          the center of the cheesecake will
          slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the
          cheesecake sit
          in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool
          cheesecake
          completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</p><br>
        <i class="icons">6</i><p>Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then
          remove the rim. Using a clean
          sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water between
          each
          slice.</p><br>
        <i class="icons">7</i><p>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the
          refrigerator for up to 5 days.</p><br>
